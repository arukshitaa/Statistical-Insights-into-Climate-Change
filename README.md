# Statistical Insights into Climate Change

This project presents a **Data-Driven Statistical Analysis** of global climate change indicators, focusing on understanding historical patterns and forecasting future impacts.  
It supports **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Climate Action** by identifying major contributors to climate change and providing predictive insights for informed policy decisions.

---

## 📊 Overview
We analyzed climate change indicators from **1995–2022**, focusing on:
- 🌫️ **CO₂ Emissions**
- 🌪️ **Disaster Frequency**
- 🌍 **Informed Risk**
- 🌡️ **Annual Surface Temperature Change**
Using statistical and predictive modeling techniques, we explored both **global** and **country-level trends**, with a deep dive into **India’s industrial emissions profile**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Analyze long-term trends in major climate indicators.  
2. Compare **developed vs. developing nations** in emissions and temperature change.  
3. Identify **key industrial contributors** to CO₂ emissions in India.  
4. Forecast **future climate scenarios** to support climate policy development.
